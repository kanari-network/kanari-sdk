# MonaOS

A modular blockchain operating system with a Move-based virtual machine.

## Overview

MonaOS is a blockchain operating system that provides:
- Move virtual machine implementation
- Gas metering and resource tracking
- Flexible state management
- Transaction processing pipeline

## Components

### mona-vm

The core virtual machine implementation:
- Transaction execution
- Gas metering
- State management
- Move code execution

```rust
let vm = MonaVM::new();
let result = vm.execute_transaction(tx, context);
```

### mona-types

Core types and utilities:
- Gas parameters and metering
- Transaction types
- State management types
- Common utilities

```rust
let params = GasParameters::default();
let meter = GasMeter::new(1000, params);
```

## Getting Started

1. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

2. Run tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Gas System

MonaOS uses a detailed gas metering system:

- Base operation costs
- Move execution costs
- Storage operation costs
- Transaction costs

Example gas configuration:
```rust
let gas_params = GasParameters {
    base: BaseCosts {
        account_creation: 100,
        signature_verification: 50,
        // ...
    },
    // ...
};
```
