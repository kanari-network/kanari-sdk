# K2

K2 is a core crate within the Kanari SDK, providing essential functionalities for building blockchain applications. It likely encompasses key components such as:

Data Structures: Definitions for fundamental blockchain elements like blocks, transactions, and state.
Consensus Mechanisms: Implementation of consensus algorithms for block validation and chain agreement.
Virtual Machine Integration: Support for executing smart contracts through a virtual machine (e.g., MoveVM).
Cryptography: Cryptographic primitives for secure transactions and data integrity.
Networking: Networking protocols for peer-to-peer communication and block propagation.
APIs: APIs for interacting with the blockchain and managing accounts.
K2 serves as a foundational layer upon which higher-level blockchain applications and services can be built within the Kanari ecosystem.
