# Simulator

The `simulator` crate drives the protocols through a **discrete-event simulator**. All time is
simulated — no wall-clock delay — and everything runs in a single process against a seeded RNG, so
each run is fully reproducible. Unlike the [geo-replicated testbed](orchestrator.md), the simulator
isn't about measuring real wire performance; it's about exercising the protocols under
precisely-controlled network, load, and failure scenarios.

What's simulated and what's real:

- **Simulated**: time, the inter-replica network (uniform-random latency), and cryptography
  (disabled — signatures are skipped).
- **Real**: the `consensus` crate, the `replica` orchestration, the block pipeline, the commit rule,
  the WAL-backed storage (each replica gets its own temporary WAL-backed store, discarded at the end
  of the run), and the metrics stack. Faults you observe in a simulation run map directly onto faults
  in the actual protocol code.

## Running a Simulation

The entry point is the `simulate` subcommand of the `replica` binary. With no arguments it runs a
single simulation with the built-in defaults (committee of 10, 20 s, full mesh, Mysticeti):

```bash
cargo run --release simulate
```

To dump the built-in defaults as an annotated YAML starting point:

```bash
cargo run simulate --dump-config > my-sim.yaml
```

To run a custom config:

```bash
cargo run --release simulate --config-path my-sim.yaml
```

A single YAML file can hold either one simulation (a mapping) or a suite of simulations (a top-level
sequence). Each entry of a suite is a full `SimulationConfig`, so entries can independently vary any
parameter. Suites run sequentially and print a final summary table comparing every run.

See [`crates/simulator/examples/single.yaml`](../crates/simulator/examples/single.yaml) for the
annotated single-run template and
[`crates/simulator/examples/suite.yaml`](../crates/simulator/examples/suite.yaml) for a suite that
sweeps committee size, latency, topology, and protocol variant.

## Configuration Reference

All fields are optional and fall back to the defaults shown.

| Field                               | Default                               | Description |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `name`                              | _(unset)_                             | Optional label shown in logs and the suite summary table. |
| `committee_size`                    | `10`                                  | Number of replicas. Stake is uniform. |
| `latency_min_ms` / `latency_max_ms` | `50` / `100`                          | Range for per-message link latency (min inclusive, max exclusive), sampled uniformly for every delivery. |
| `topology`                          | `fullMesh`                            | Network topology — see below. |
| `duration_secs`                     | `20`                                  | Simulated time for which to run the simulation. |
| `rng_seed`                          | `0`                                   | Seed for the deterministic RNG. Change this to get different per-run noise while keeping everything else fixed. |
| `replica_parameters`                | `ReplicaParameters::default()`        | Same tunables as a real replica: DAG round timeout, max block size, consensus protocol, leader count. |
| `load_generator`                    | `LoadGeneratorConfig::new_for_test()` | Built-in transaction generator (`load` tx/s, `transaction_size`, `initial_delay`). `null` for empty blocks. |

## Network Topologies

The `topology` field selects how the simulated network is wired at the start of the run (connections
are established once and held for the duration):

- **`fullMesh`** — every replica connects to every other. This is the happy path.
- **`oneDown: <index>`** — every replica except `<index>` is fully connected; `<index>` is isolated.
  Probes the `f = 1` failure mode.
- **`star: <center>`** — only `<center>` is connected to all other replicas; non-center replicas can
  only reach each other through the centre. Useful for studying bottlenecks and leader-fairness
  behaviour under a single hub.
- **`partition: [[...], [...], ...]`** — the committee is split into the listed groups; replicas
  only connect inside their own group. Lets you construct arbitrary network splits — two equal
  halves exercise "no quorum on either side" conditions.

## Outcomes

Every run ends with one of three verdicts, classified by comparing the committed-leader sequences of
every replica:

| Outcome      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Pass`       | Every replica's committed prefix agrees with the others' and at least one replica committed a leader.                                                                |
| `NoProgress` | Every replica's commits are consistent but none committed a leader. Expected under unrecoverable partitions (e.g. a symmetric split, or `star` on a crashed centre). |
| `Diverged`   | At least two replicas disagree on a commit within their shared prefix. This is a safety violation and fails the run.                                                 |

A suite's final exit code is non-zero if any simulation `Diverged`.

## Saving Detailed Results

Pass `--output-dir <DIR>` and the simulator drops a fixed set of artefacts on disk for each run.
The directory is created if it doesn't exist.

```bash
cargo run --release simulate \
    --config-path crates/simulator/examples/suite.yaml \
    --output-dir results/
```

For a single-run invocation the artefacts land directly in `<output-dir>/`. For a suite, each
simulation gets its own subdirectory named after the run (`name` field, sanitised) or by 1-based
index when unnamed. Files are written atomically (`NamedTempFile` + `persist`), so a mid-write crash
leaves each file either intact or absent — never half-written.

| File                       | Contents                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<output-dir>/tracing.log` | Suite-wide tracing log (one log for the whole invocation).                                                                                                |
| `<run>/config.yaml`        | The full `SimulationConfig` that produced the run, including any defaults filled in.                                                                      |
| `<run>/meta.yaml`          | `{ outcome, duration_secs, kind: simulation, timestamp_unix }`.                                                                                           |
| `<run>/metrics-<replica>.prom` | One Prometheus text exposition per replica (`metrics-A.prom`, `metrics-B.prom`, …), each self-contained and parseable by `promtool` and most TSDB ingesters. |
| `<run>/dag.ndjson`         | _(opt-in via `--export-dag`)_ every committed sub-DAG, one JSON object per line. Can be many GB; off by default.                                          |

## Programmatic Use

The simulator is also usable as a library, which is how the integration tests in
[`crates/simulator/tests/simulation.rs`](../crates/simulator/tests/simulation.rs) drive it. A
minimal example:

```rust
use replica::result::Outcome;
use simulator::{NetworkTopology, SimulationConfig, SimulationRunner};

#[test]
fn one_down_stays_consistent() {
    let config = SimulationConfig {
        committee_size: 7,
        topology: NetworkTopology::OneDown(0),
        duration_secs: 40,
        ..Default::default()
    };

    let result = SimulationRunner::new(config).run().expect("simulation");

    assert_ne!(result.outcome, Outcome::Diverged);
    assert!(!result.metrics.is_empty());
}
```

`SimulationRunner::run` returns an `io::Result<RunResult<SimulationConfig>>` carrying per-replica
`MetricsSnapshot`s, the derived `Outcome`, the per-replica storages, and the original config.
`SimulationRunner::from_yaml` loads a `SimulationConfig` from disk, useful when test cases share
configuration with the CLI. The committed sub-DAGs stay available through the returned storages —
that is how the CLI's `--export-dag` flag produces `dag.ndjson` after the run. Because every run is
deterministic in the `rng_seed`, these tests are reproducible across machines.
