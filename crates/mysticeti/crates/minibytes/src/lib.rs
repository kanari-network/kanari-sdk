//!
//! This crate provides the [`Bytes`] type. It is similar to `&[u8]`:
//! cloning or slicing are zero-copy. Unlike `&[u8]`, `Bytes` does not
//! have a lifetime. This is done by maintaining the life cycle of the
//! underlying storage using reference count.
//!
//! Aside from supporting `Vec<u8>` as the underlying storage, [`Bytes`]
//! also supports [`memmap2::Mmap`]. Libraries can implement
//! [`BytesOwner`] for other types to further extend storage support.
