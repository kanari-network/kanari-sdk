//! `undecided` scenario across the protocol matrix.
//!
//! L1 cohort's first leader (offset 0) is undecided after the direct phase, and
//! the DAG doesn't extend far enough for a later anchor to resolve it. The
//! committer's `take_while` over decided statuses sees the undecided leader at
//! the front of the cohort and truncates the entire sequence.
