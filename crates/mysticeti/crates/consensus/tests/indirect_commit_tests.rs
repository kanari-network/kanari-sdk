//! `indirect_commit` scenario across the protocol matrix.
//!
//! Construction varies on `wave_length`:
//! - `wl == 2`: a single layer at the (collapsed) voting/decision round with
//!   `(direct_commit_quorum - 1)` voters and the rest non-voters. That's enough
//!   for the later anchor to reach `anchor_link_size` certificate paths while
//!   keeping direct commit below threshold.
//! - `wl >= 3`: `build_split_chain` to the voting round with all
//!   `direct_commit_quorum` authorities voting (final blamers = `n - direct_commit_quorum`),
//!   then a hand-crafted decision-round layer where only
//!   `(direct_commit_quorum - 1)` certifiers fully link to the voters.
//!
//! For multi-leader cohorts, we sweep `target_offset` over `0..K`: the targeted
//! cohort leader is the one driven into indirect-commit, while the remaining
//! `K-1` cohort members direct-commit unchanged.
