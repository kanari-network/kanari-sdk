//! `direct_commit_partial_round` scenario across the protocol matrix.
//!
//! After the first cohort leader at L1 is treated as already-committed,
//! calling `try_commit` again with that leader as the seed must yield the
//! remaining `K-1` cohort members in offset order. Exercises mid-cohort
//! resumption — a code path not covered by the other scenarios, which either
//! seed at a cohort boundary (`multiple_direct_commit`) or seed with the
//! *last* of a cohort and expect an empty sequence (`idempotence`).
