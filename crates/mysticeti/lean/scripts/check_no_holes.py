"""Fail if any Lean source contains a proof hole or soundness escape hatch.

The kernel guarantees that every proof that *exists* is correct; the
constructs below let a file build while smuggling in unproven assumptions:

    sorry / admit     accept a goal without proof (warning only, build stays green)
    axiom             assume a statement with no proof at all
    native_decide     trust compiled code instead of the kernel
    unsafe / partial  opt out of soundness / termination checking

Comments are stripped before matching, so prose may mention the words
(e.g. "partial synchrony") freely.

Additionally, every file named `Statement.lean` must be proof-free
(definitions and prose only): a theorem/lemma/example/instance there would
sit outside the audit convention that Statement files are read in full and
proof files not at all.

Finally, `View.full` may appear in the code of no `Statement.lean` and
no `Model/` file: a liveness statement concludes on a view a replica
can hold. Comments are stripped first, so prose may mention it; the
`def View.full` site itself is vocabulary, not a claim, and is exempt.

This script is part of the trusted base: it is meant to be read once,
top to bottom, and then believed. Keep it dumb.
