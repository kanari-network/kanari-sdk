# Statement: eventual decision — the ledger does not stall

The liveness headline, composing the two previous claims. Direct
liveness commits any synchronised, populated, correct-led wave; indirect
liveness settles everything below a committed run. The one ingredient
still missing is fairness: the schedule must actually *offer* runs of
correct-led slots.

Two Props, factored so each is about one thing:

- `RunDecidesBelow`: the per-universe workhorse with the run location
  `b` explicit — a synchronised quorum whose members lead the `c` slots
  `b, …, b + c − 1` and fill every round of the run's span decides every
  slot below `b`. No fairness: where the run sits is a hypothesis.
- `RunsRecur`: the schedule-only claim — fairness places a `T`-led run
  past any slot and any round. No universe: pure `Slots` arithmetic.

The two compose by direct application (get the run location from
`RunsRecur`, hand it to `RunDecidesBelow`): for every slot `k` there is
a bound `b ≥ k` with every slot below `b` decided at the eventual view —
verdicts march past any point, which is exactly "the ledger does not
stall". That composed form is stated and proven on the generated side
(`ledgerProgress` in `Proof.lean`); the audited content is exactly the
two Props above.

section Schedule

variable (Replica : Type*) [S : Slots Replica]

/-- Fair leader election, in the only form liveness needs: the schedule
places `c` consecutive `T`-led slots arbitrarily far out (`k` is
universal, so such runs recur forever). A round-robin schedule satisfies
this exactly when its rotation contains `c` consecutive `T`-members —
always true for `c = 3` at the classical bound `n = 3f + 1`, but NOT
guaranteed at the hybrid bound (many crashed replicas can be spaced so
no three correct ones are adjacent) — which is why fairness is a stated
hypothesis on the schedule rather than a theorem about it. Which leader
schedules provide it is a separate concern, outside this development. -/

  ∀ k, ∃ k', k ≤ k' ∧ ∀ i, i < c → S.leader (k' + i) ∈ T

/-- **Fairness places a run wherever needed**: past any slot `k` and any
round `R`, some run of `c` consecutive `T`-led slots begins. Pure
schedule arithmetic — no universe appears; feeding the produced location
to `RunDecidesBelow` is the liveness composition. -/
