# Proof: eventual decision

Generated. The two conjuncts come from the helpers; `ledgerProgress` is
the composed headline — "the ledger does not stall" — obtained by
feeding the run location `RunsRecur` produces into `RunDecidesBelow`.

/-- **The ledger does not stall** (the composed corollary): under a fair
schedule, past every slot `k` and round `R` there is a bound `b` such
that any universe in which `T` is synchronised and fills the run's span
has every slot below `b` decided on any view caught up to the run's
last decision round. -/
