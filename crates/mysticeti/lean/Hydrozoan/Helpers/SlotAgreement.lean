# The seam toolkit

Generated proof infrastructure for `SlotAgreement`: the "rung fires"
lemmas (an eligible anchor's history contains the evidence of any direct
commit), the starvation and skip negatives (nothing conflicting survives
on either rung), and the abstract anchor-comparison lemma. Nothing here
is part of the audit surface.

/-- `n + f < q + q_slow` — an anchor's parents meet any slow commit
(Phase 2's row 5). Standalone this is an identity of truncated ℕ
arithmetic (both sides of `q + q_slow` sum to `n + f + 1`); its content
materializes in consumers where `q` also bounds a real author-set
cardinality. Same for the starvation row below. -/
theorem nf_lt_q_add_qSlow :
    Fintype.card Replica + F.f < q Replica + qSlow Replica := by
  have := F.card_replicas
  simp only [q, qSlow]
  omega

/-- `n + f < q_fast + q_weak` — a fast commit starves conflicts below
the weak rung (Phase 2's row 3). -/

  omega

/-- The **strengthened** footprint row: `n + q_weak + f ≤ q_fast + q`.
Only the non-Byzantine overlap of an anchor's parent authors with the
fast quorum contributes anchor-linked votes — a Byzantine author's
reachable block may be its non-voting equivocation — so the design
note's `q_fast + q − n ≥ q_weak` must absorb an extra `f`. Still holds
at every `k ≥ 0`; tight at the tight replica count when `c + k` is even
(odd `c + k` leaves one unit of slack). -/
