# Direct-commit liveness — proof

Generated proof layer; not part of the audit surface. Both conjuncts
are the wave chain of `Helpers/DirectLiveness.lean`; the harvest form
adds the caught-up-view lift (`slowCommitInView_of_coversUpto`) and
`Decided.directSlow`. `fastLatency` is the demoted performance
characterization, proven with the same care.
