# Direct-commit liveness — statement

A synchronised, populated wave with a correct leader commits. One claim
forms `Statement`: `CommitLiveness`, concluding both the slow-commit
threshold and its harvest as a `Decided` verdict on any view caught up
to the decision round (`View.CoversUpto`) — the eventual view is the
special case.
The opportunistic pair (`FastLatency`, `SkipLatency`) is
**deliberately outside `Statement`**: both are performance
characterizations — they fire exactly when the actual faults fit the
fast allowance `p` — not liveness.

The guaranteed path is the slow one, and that is the design decision
this phase verifies: with `c` crashes and `f` silent Byzantine
replicas, only `q = n − f − c` voters are certain, and `q < q_fast` in
general — so the fast path cannot be guaranteed, while
`q_cert ≤ q` (Phase 2's "slow path collectible" row) and `q_slow ≤ q`
make the slow path reachable by the guaranteed quorum alone.

/-- **Commit liveness**: a quorum-sized set of correct replicas,
populated through the wave's three rounds and synchronised from some
`R` at or before the wave, commits its correct leader — the slow-commit
threshold is met, and the decision logic outputs the commit verdict on
any view caught up to the decision round (the harvest form the later
phases consume). The certificates sit at the decision round, so a
caught-up view holds them; the eventual view is caught up to every
horizon.

`SlowCommit` here is a threshold fact, not a route: the fast path may
also fire in the same universe (the rule predicates are not
exclusive) — this is the one the guaranteed quorum always reaches. -/

/-- **Performance, not liveness — deliberately outside `Statement`.**
When the *actual* faults fit the fast allowance `p`, a synchronised,
populated wave with a correct leader fires the fast path in two rounds:
`|Correct| = n − |byzantine ∪ crashed| ≥ n − p = q_fast`. The
protocol's two-round latency claim; it needs all of `Correct` —
a quorum-sized `T` does not suffice in general (only when `f + c ≤ p`
does the quorum reach `q_fast`, as in the low-fault witness) — and only
the propose and voting rounds. -/
def FastLatency (U : BlockUniverse Replica BlockId) : Prop :=
  ∀ (R k : ℕ),                           -- for any round R and slot k:
    (F.byzantine ∪ F.crashed).card ≤ p Replica →  -- ACTUAL faults fit p,
    Synchronised U R →                   -- all correct synchronised from R,
    R ≤ S.slotRound k →                  -- the wave lies at or after R,
    Populated U (S.slotRound k) →        -- correct fill the propose round ...
    Populated U (S.slotRound k + 1) →    -- ... and the voting round,
    S.leader k ∈ (Correct : Finset Replica) →  -- and the leader is correct:
    ∃ L, IsLeaderBlock U k L ∧           -- then a candidate exists ...
      FastCommit U L (S.slotRound k)     -- ... and it fast-commits (2 rounds)

/-- **Performance, not liveness — the skip half of the opportunistic
pair.** With ≤ p actual faults, a slot whose leader produced no
candidate at all is skipped directly at the voting round: every
voting-round block blames it vacuously, and the correct pool alone
reaches the q_fast blame quorum. Beyond p faults the direct skip may
be unreachable — it is opportunistic, not guaranteed — and the slot
resolves indirectly instead (later phases). No synchrony hypothesis:
blames reference nothing. -/

    Populated U (S.slotRound k + 1) →    -- correct fill the voting round,
    (∀ L, ¬ IsLeaderBlock U k L) →       -- and no candidate exists:
    SkippedLeader U k                    -- then the slot skips directly
