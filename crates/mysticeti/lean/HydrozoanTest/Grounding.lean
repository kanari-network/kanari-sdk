# Witness: grounding

End-to-end applications of the grounding theorem — the mechanical
guard against silently strengthened hypotheses (any added EXPLICIT
premise breaks an application by arity; the spelled-out example types
break conclusion weakenings by type mismatch):

* the wave-aligned schedule pinned pointwise: slot `k` proposes at
  round `k`, the leader holds for a whole three-slot wave, and the
  rotation re-enters after `3 · 7` slots;
* `WaveRobinFair` applied premise-free at TWO configurations — the
  pinned `Fin 7` table (Byzantine `{0}`, crashed `{1}`, `q = 5`) and
  the low-fault `Fin 4` one — including extracting a run past slot 5;
  plus the `T = ∅` negative (fairness is not trivially true of every
  `T`);
* `HypothesesRealizable` applied at `T = univ` — a `T` containing the
  Byzantine replica 0 and the crashed replica 1 — killing any
  `T ⊆ Correct` strengthening, and at `T = Correct` with
  `|T| = 5 = q`, the exact-quorum boundary;
* `GroundedProgress` applied at `k = 5` (`Fin 7`) and at the `k = 0`
  boundary (`Fin 4`), its commit clause and everything-below clause
  both spelled out;
* the pigeonhole contrast made concrete: PER-SLOT rotation at the
  tight `Fin 5` configuration (`f = 0`, `c = 2`, `k = 0`, crashed
  `{0, 3}`) provably starves every correct 3-run — the wave-aligned
  grain is necessary for premise-free fairness, not a stylistic
  choice.

/-! ## The pigeonhole contrast: per-slot rotation starves at the bound

`WaveRobinFair`'s docstring says per-slot rotation needs the replica
count to exceed three times the actual fault count. The tiniest
counterexample inside the fault bounds: `n = 5`, `f = 0`, `c = 2`,
`k = 0` (tight: `3·0 + 2·2 + 0 + 1 = 5`), crashed at positions 0 and 3.
Every window of three consecutive residues mod 5 hits 0 or 3, so no
correct 3-run ever forms — per-slot rotation is UNFAIR at the hybrid
bound, which is exactly why `waveRobin` rotates at wave grain. -/
