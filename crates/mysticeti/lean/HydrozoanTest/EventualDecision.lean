# Witness: eventual decision fires

The low-fault `Fin 4` configuration (replica 1 crashed, pipelined
schedule leader `k % 4`) on an eight-round table:

* **`RunDecidesBelow` end-to-end, fully concrete**: the run at slots
  2, 3, 4 (leaders 2, 3, 0 — all correct) with every hypothesis
  discharged — synchrony from round 0, population over the run's span
  (rounds 2–6), leaders pinned — decides slots 0 and 1. Rounds 0–6 are
  load-bearing: the composition derives the run commits via direct
  liveness, whose slot-4 wave needs its decision round 6 populated (the
  indirect-liveness descent, by contrast, consumed the commits
  ready-made); round 7 is unconsumed headroom.
* **The partial view `v10`** (rounds 0–6; round 7 outside):
  `RunDecidesBelow` applied at it pins the statement's `CoversUpto`
  horizon — every other application discharges the premise with
  `coversUpto_full`, which proves *any* horizon, so this is the one
  guard against a silently raised horizon constant.
* **`fairRun_four`**: the pipelined schedule is provably fair to the
  correct set at `c = 3` — runs start at every `k' = 4k + 2` — proved
  from the definition, not by finite enumeration.
* **`RunsRecur` and `ledgerProgress` end-to-end**: applied with every
  hypothesis discharged concretely. Their conclusions produce an opaque
  bound `b` (existential), so no finite table can also instantiate what
  follows it — the concrete guard for that part is the
  `RunDecidesBelow` application above, which is why the workhorse sits
  in the Statement rather than in a helper.
