# Witness: the liveness hardening batch

Three configurations, each killing a mutation class the indirect- and
eventual-decision phases' cold audits found unguarded:

* **A proper-subset `T`** (`U12`, eight replicas): a configuration whose
  ACTUAL faults undershoot the bounds — one Byzantine, nobody crashed —
  so `|Correct| = 7 > q = 6`, and the liveness theorem is applied at a
  six-member `T` that excludes the correct replica 7, which authors one
  genesis block nobody references and then goes silent. Every previous
  application used `T = Correct`; this one kills the silent
  strengthenings `T ⊆ Correct → T = Correct` and
  population/synchrony-on-`T` → on-all-of-`Correct`: both strengthened
  hypotheses are genuinely FALSE at `U12` (pinned) while their
  `T`-relative forms hold.
* **Route diversification** (`U13`, the frozen seven-replica
  configuration): one table where the three below-run slots resolve by
  three different routes — slot 0 by the certificate rung (five votes =
  `q_cert` < `q_fast`, exactly one certificate, one blame), slot 1
  directly, slot 2 by the indirect skip (two votes: below `q_weak`, yet
  starving the blame quorum). The indirect pair is exclusive: for slots
  0 and 2 the pinned route is provably the ONLY one available in any
  view; slot 1 is deliberately multi-route. The anchors diversify too:
  slot 0's anchor is the development's first SLOW-committed anchor
  (five supporters < `q_fast`, six certifiers ≥ `q_slow`).
* **A sparse schedule** (`U14`, six replicas, three-round spacing): the
  first non-pipelined schedule. With three rounds between slots,
  `SpansEligible` holds already at `c = 1`, and the descent fires below
  a SINGLE committed slot — killing the `0 < c → 3 ≤ c` strengthening
  disclosed by the descent and run witnesses, and pinning that the
  run-length
  requirement is a property of the schedule's density, not of the
  theorem.
