# 3. Protocol Implementation and Features

## 3.1 Smart Contract Architecture

The Kanari Network protocol implements its core functionality through a series of Move smart contracts:

```move
module Kanari::core {
    struct MetadataAsset has key {
        id: vector<u8>,
        owner: address,
        hash: vector<u8>,
        version: u64,
        created_at: u64,
        updated_at: u64
    }

    struct Permission has store {
        read: bool,
        write: bool,
        admin: bool
    }
}
```

## 3.2 Core Features

### 3.2.1 Metadata Verification

The protocol ensures data integrity through:

- SHA-256 hash verification
- Multi-signature validation
- Timestamp verification
- Version control checks

### 3.2.2 Access Control System

Access management is implemented via:

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
2. Dynamic permission management
3. Multi-level authorization
4. Granular access policies

### 3.2.3 Version Management

Version control features include:

- Immutable version history
- Atomic updates
- Branching support
- Conflict resolution
- Merkle-based verification

## 3.3 Protocol Operations

### 3.3.1 Basic Operations

```move
public fun create_metadata(
    owner: address,
    hash: vector<u8>,
    permissions: Permission
) acquires State {
    // Implementation details
}

public fun update_metadata(
    id: vector<u8>,
    new_hash: vector<u8>
) acquires State, MetadataAsset {
    // Implementation details
}
```

### 3.3.2 Advanced Features

- Cross-chain interoperability
- Batch processing
- Automated validation
- Event notifications
- Analytics support

## 3.4 Security Considerations

The protocol implements several security measures:

1. **Access Control**
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Time-based permissions
   - Role delegation

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest
   - Secure key management
   - Protected metadata fields

3. **Network Security**
   - DDoS protection
   - Sybil resistance
   - Byzantine fault tolerance

## 3.5 Performance Optimization

Performance is enhanced through:

- Efficient data structures
- Optimized validation
- Caching mechanisms
- Parallel processing
- State compression
