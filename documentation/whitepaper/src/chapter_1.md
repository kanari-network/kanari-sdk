### Abstract

A decentralized metadata management protocol would enable secure and verifiable digital asset information to be managed without relying on centralized storage providers. While existing solutions handle file storage, they lack robust metadata management capabilities necessary for enterprise-grade applications. Digital signatures and blockchain technology provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if metadata integrity and ownership verification cannot be guaranteed.

We propose a metadata management protocol using Move VM technology that ensures data integrity, ownership verification, and access control through a decentralized network. The protocol maintains cryptographically secured metadata records that cannot be altered without proper authorization, forming an immutable chain of ownership and version history. This system enables transparent yet secure metadata management while eliminating single points of failure.

### 1. Introduction

Digital asset management in Web3 has come to rely heavily on centralized metadata storage solutions, creating security vulnerabilities and trust dependencies. While decentralized storage protocols like IPFS handle raw file data effectively, they lack sophisticated metadata management capabilities required for enterprise adoption. The current approach suffers from several inherent weaknesses:

- Metadata tampering risks
- Centralized points of failure
- Limited ownership verification
- Insufficient access controls
- Poor version management

What is needed is a protocol that provides cryptographically secure metadata management without requiring trust in centralized parties. This would allow any participant to verify file authenticity, prove ownership, and manage access permissions in a fully decentralized manner. In this paper, we present Kanari Network - a protocol leveraging Move VM to enable secure, transparent and efficient metadata management in the Web3 ecosystem.
