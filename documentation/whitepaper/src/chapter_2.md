# 2. Technical Architecture

## 2.1 System Overview

The Kanari Network protocol is built on three fundamental pillars:

1. **Move VM Layer**: Handles smart contract execution and state management
2. **Metadata Protocol**: Manages file metadata structure and validation
3. **Network Layer**: Facilitates decentralized communication and consensus

## 2.2 Move VM Integration

The Move VM provides several critical capabilities for metadata management:

- Type-safe asset handling
- Resource-oriented programming model
- Formal verification of critical paths
- Deterministic execution
- Native support for digital asset operations

```rust
module Kanari::metadata {
    struct MetadataRecord has key {
        id: ID,
        hash: vector<u8>,
        owner: address,
        version: u64,
        timestamp: u64,
        permissions: Permissions,
    }
}
```

## 2.3 Metadata Protocol Design

### 2.3.1 Core Components

The metadata protocol implements:

- Cryptographic validation mechanisms
- Ownership verification system
- Version control management
- Access control framework
- Cross-chain compatibility layer

### 2.3.2 Security Model

Security is enforced through:

1. Cryptographic proofs of ownership
2. Multi-signature authorization
3. Role-based access control (RBAC)
4. Tamper-evident logging
5. Audit trail maintenance

## 2.4 Network Architecture

The network layer provides:

- Distributed metadata storage
- Peer-to-peer communication
- Consensus mechanism
- State synchronization
- Network security

### 2.4.1 Consensus Mechanism

The network achieves consensus through:

- BFT-based agreement
- Validator node participation
- Stake-weighted voting
- Fast finality guarantees

### 2.4.2 State Management

State transitions are managed via:

- Atomic operations
- Version vectors
- Merkle-based verification
- State checkpointing
